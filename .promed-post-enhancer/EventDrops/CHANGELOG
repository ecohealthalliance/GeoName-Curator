# CHANGELOG

## 0.3.0

* API Change: The data for each event line object must now be in the `data` property (was `date`).
* Pass any data object to each drop and specify the date property with a callback.
* The SVG is now responsive and fit with its parent
* Rename `eventHover`, `eventClick` and `eventZoom` events to `mouseover`, `click` and `zoomend` respectively.
* Adding `mouseout` handler

## 0.2.0

* Display metaballs by default instead of simple dots
* Adding `eventClick` event handler on drops
* Use of Webpack instead of Babel for development tasks
* Full rewrite of the code base for better code splitting (may cause some BC breaks)
