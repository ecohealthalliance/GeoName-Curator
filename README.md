# eidr-connect

Global Repository of Infectious Disease Data


## Building the docker image, and running the container

Build the docker image  
`sudo docker build -t eidr-connect .`

Run the newly built image using docker-compose  
`sudo docker-compose -f eidr-compose.yml up -d`

## Testing with docker

### Step 1: build the image

```
docker build -t eidr-connect-test -f test.Dockerfile .
```

### Step 2: run docker-compose (Step 1 only needs done once)

Note: docker-compose will bring up two containers `eidrconnect_app_1` and `eidrconnect_mongodb_1` that have an isoloated IP network.  They can communicate via hostname `app` and `mongodb`, which will be converted into IP addresses via /etc/hosts.
The default CMD for `app` is to start the test server using `start-test-server.sh`.  See the eird-connect-test.yml for the specifics.

```
docker-compose -f eidr-connect-test.yml up -d
docker exec -it --user meteor eidrconnect_app_1 ./run-tests.sh --mongo_host=mongodb --is_docker=true
docker-compose -f eidr-connect-test.yml down
```

## Testing on OSX

Install testing dependencies
```
npm install
```

Run the meteor test application
```
meteor npm run-script start-test-server
```

- Or you may customize the script by running directly with the following optional args:
```
./start-test-server.sh --app_port=3001 --mongo_host=127.0.0.1 --mongo_port=27017 --test_db=eidr-connect-test --prod_db=eidr-connect
```

Tags

To run only tests with certain tags (https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Tags):
```
./start-test-server.sh --tags=@dev ...
```
- Or if running the NPM script:
```
TAGS=@dev meteor npm run-script start-test-server
```


Execute the test runner to run all tests
```
npm run chimp-test
```

- Or include the watch flag to continuously execute watched tests after file changes
```
npm run chimp-watch
```

- Or you may customize the script by running directly with the following optional args:
```
./run-tests.sh --watch=true --app_uri=http://127.0.0.1 --app_port=3001
```

Stop the meteor test application
```
npm run-script stop-test-server
```
